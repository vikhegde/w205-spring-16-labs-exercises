Q. Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals
Ans.
   My conclusion is that the below list represents (in descending order)
   the 10 procedures that are the most variable between hospitals.
   Another conclusion is that even the most variable procedure does not have
   very high variability.
   
   The following 10 procedures are the 10 most variable procedures in
   descending order.

10 ["Home Management Plan of Care ... Document..."] 12.71	8580.0	  89.37

   The results above support my conclusion that that even the most variable
   procedures do not show very high variability. The standard deviation
   for even the most variable procedure is only 21 i.e. approximately 20
   normalized score points is the average variation of a data point from the
   mean for this measure.

   The scores used are normalized scores calculated as per the procedure
   in investigations/best_hospitals/best_hospitals.txt

   The standard deviation was chosen over variance as a measure of
   variability because it has the same units as the normalized
   score.

   The standard deviation was calculated using the stddev_pop()
   aggregate function. It was computed separately for each measure
   across all hospitals and then the procedures were ranked
   based on descending order of variability.

   The rationale for normalizing scores is the same as in the best hospitals
   case. See investigations/best_hospitals/best_hospitals.txt
