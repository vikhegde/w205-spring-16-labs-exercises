Q. Which state are models of high quality care that provide the best care based on quality measures ?
Ans.
   My conclusion is that the below list represents (in order)
   the 10 best states (among all states with at least 8 measures of
   quality) and that an aggregate rank based on rankings on each indivdual
   quality measure is a more appropriate way of measuring overall quality
   of care than to simply add average together different quality scores.
   Another conclusion that can be drawn from the data is that the top 10
   states are very close to each other in terms of average scores.
   
   The following 10 states are the 10 best states that provide the
   best quality of care as measured over a wide array (at least 8 quality
   measures) of measures.

10	VA 272364.80	88.02      18.46


   The results above support my conclusion that simply summing
   different measures does not produce an accurate list of best hospitals.
   This is somewhat obvious without even looking at the data since a
   state with many hospitals will have a higher total score than a state
   with few hospitals (fewer quality scores)
   It is also evident from the table above, that higher rated states do not
   necessarily have the largest aggregate score (i.e. sum of scores
   of different quality measures). For example #1 state Utah has an
   aggregate score of of only 96303 while #10 state Virginia
   has a higher aggregate score of 272364. The results also support the
   conclusion that the top 10 states are very close to each other
   since all of the top 10 states have average scores of about 87/88
   and similar standard deviations of 18/19

   The scores used are normalized scores calculated as per the procedure
   in investigations/best_hospitals/best_hospitals.txt

   Once the scores are normalized we average scores for each
   (state, measure) combination across all hospitals in the state.
   We then rank all the states on each measure i.e. each state
   gets a separate rank for each measure
   We then find the average rank of each state across all measures
   (which creates one average rank for each state). We then rank states
   by their average rank.

   The rationale for ranking all the state on each measure separately is
   the same as in the case of best hospitals. Using rankings instead of
   average scores is a better way of combining different measures.
   An example will best illustrate the problem with the average
   score approach. Consider a measure M1 where the scores are high for
   all states and tightly clustered and another measure M2
   where the scores are very low and are very different. If we just add
   scores for measures M1 and M2 the disparity in the low scores for
   M2 will be lost. A ranking approach removes the idiosyncracies of the
   individual measures.
  
   The rationale for normalizing scores is the same as in the best hospitals
   case. See investigations/best_hospitals/best_hospitals.txt
