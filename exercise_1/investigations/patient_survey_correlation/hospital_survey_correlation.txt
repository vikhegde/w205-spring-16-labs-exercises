Q. Are average scores for hospital quality correlated with patient survey
   response
Ans.
   My conclusion is that average scores for hospital quality are not
   correlated with patient survey scores.

   The Pearson correlation coefficient calculated by comparing ranks of
   hospitals based on average normalized scores and ranks of hospitals
   based on HCAHPS total scores (calculation of this metric is given below)
   is 0.079 which is quite close to 0. 

   The low value for the correlation coefficient supports my conclusion that
   average scores for hospital quality are not correlated with patient
   surveys.

   The normalized scores used to calculate hospital average socres
   are calculated as per the normalization procedure described in
   in investigations/best_hospitals/best_hospitals.txt

   The raw patient survey data consists of survey responses on
   a number of questions and includes an achivement score,
   an improvement score (which is improvment relative to a
   baseline score of a baseline year, several years back)
   and a dimension score which is the higher of the
   achievment and improvement scores. In addition there
   is a HCAHPS Base score (out of 80) and HCAHPS consistency score
   (out of 20) which is used computed from the other survey scores
   and the sum is a score out of 100 which is used by the Government
   as an composite score for each patient survey. I decided to use
   this composite score from every survey as a measure of a hospitals score
   and used the average of the composite scores for each hospital to calculate
   the hospitals rank according to patient surveys.

   After ranking each hospital based on procedure quality measures
  and then ranking each hospital based on survey composite scores, I
  calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient using the Hive corr()
  aggregation function.
