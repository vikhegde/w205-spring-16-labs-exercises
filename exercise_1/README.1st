In this exercise, I use the term procedures somewhat loosely to encompass
everything that flows from a medical procedure whether it is the number of
minutes taken to start or complete a procedure, the rate of readmission or
mortality resulting from a procedure, the presence or absence of a procedure etc.
Thus the use of the term procedure in this exercise (and in the ER diagram)
encompasses actual medical procedures, the results of procedures, the time taken
to complete a procedure, other quality measures of medical procedures etc.
